				<h2>Coffee</h2>
				<p>
				<h3>Presentation</h3>
					<p> Coffee is one of the most consumed beverages in the world. It is grown in more than 70 countries, the two leading producers are Brazil and Colombia. Canada's climate does not allow the cultivation of coffee, but there's a lot of imported grain processing. It is estimated that Canadians drink over 15 billion cups of coffee per year. The average coffee consumer drinks three cups a day. Contrary to what one might think, coffee contains vitamins and minerals, and antioxidant compounds.
					</p>
				<h3>History of coffee</h3>
					<p>Coming from a province of Ethiopia, many legends circulate about the discovery of the effects of the coffee fruit. Its consumption then grows in the Arab world of the sixteenth century, while it is still unknown in Europe. Before ending up in the cups of Western homes, coffee has been at the heart of legends but also political conflicts, religious and economic. Today, 1,500 cups are consumed per minute in France  , corresponding to 330 000 tonnes per year.
					</p>
				<h3>Legend, expansion in the World of the seventeenth century</h3>
					<p>The coffee tree is probably from a province of Ethiopia called Kaffa. Many legends circulating on the discovery stimulant properties of coffee cherries. The most famous tells the story of a young shepherd named Khaldi, intrigued by the behavior of his goats who ate the tree's fruit. In reporting this story in neighboring prior, this one had the idea to make a drink.<br><br>

					In the fifteenth century, the expansion is done first in neighboring Saudi thanks to Muslim pilgrims to Mecca. We then call this drink stimulant effects "K'hawah". Alcohol is forbidden by Islam, coffee meets a big success.<br><br>

					The first cafés opened: these cultural venues and exchanges are particularly popular among intellectuals. The coffee is then the Arab monopoly that applies not export policy.<br><br>

					In 1615, Venetian merchants nevertheless manage to bring back to Europe. The old continent was undergoing a real buzz around hot drinks with recent arrivals chocolate (1528) and tea (1610).<br><br>

					The following years, France, the Netherlands and England implant coffee trees in their colonies, to supply freely. At the same time, numerous cafes open in major cities of Europe. In France, the coffee comes through the port of Marseille. That's where we inaugurated, in 1640, the first French coffee. It was not until nearly 30 years (1672) to see the first cafe opened in the capital, near the Pont Neuf (contrary to what its name might suggest, it is the oldest bridge in Paris, completed in 1606 ). These places are then particularly popular scholars, classical philosophers and musicians.<br><br>

					In America, the arrival of the coffee is done later in 1668. It is made very popular by the episode of the "Boston Tea Party", marking the beginning of the war of independence. Annoyed heavy taxes imposed by the English King Charles III of tea, Bostonais decided to boycott British goods and to replace tea with coffee in their eating habits.

				<h3>A controversial expansion?</h3>
					<p>Throughout its expansion, coffee, by its stimulating properties on the body, will be subject to many controversies. The first dates back to 1511: in protest against the popularity of coffee, Mecca authorities want to burn the bags of seeds. According to them, the cafes are places of debauchery and political protest.<br><br>

					After arriving in Europe, Italian priests try to do ban by Pope Clement VIII, saying that coffee is the drink of infidels. Now, after having tasted a cup, the Pope was loved and wanted even baptized!<br><br>

					Two attempts bans were also held in England. In 1674, women signed a petition, claiming that coffee away their husbands, preferring to spend time at the cafe rather than the family home. Charles II was originally the second attempt. Thinking it was in these places that the revolution was forged, he wanted to close and prohibit the cafes.<br><br>

					More original: in Germany, it was thought that the drink made sterile and therefore we tried to prohibit women. Finally, in the late eighteenth century, coffee was competing seriously undermined if trade beer produced in Prussia. King Frederick the Great, therefore, tried to prohibit ...
				</p>
					<h3>Coffee today ...</h3>
				<p>Coffee is currently the second drink (after tea) most consumed in the world. Although the heaviest drinkers are in Scandinavia, France is particularly adept. From age 17, more than half of French consumes 3 , and each of us buys more than 5 kg per year 2 !<br><br>

				From an economic perspective, it is estimated that over 100 million the number of people living in the coffee sector. Coffee is even the first agricultural commodity traded in the world, before the wheat or sugar. Moreover, for many developing countries, coffee represents 80% of total exports, placing second regular currency behind oil.<br><br>

				However, coffee consumption is changing: in recent years, the pods are invading our supermarket shelves. Certainly less environmentally friendly, manufacturers have developed this system to meet the needs of practicality sought by the consumer. Great way to reconcile ecology and solidarity, fair trade also tends to shake our buying habits. Moreover, the coffee turns out the most acclaimed French consumer product.<br><br>

				The cafe has had a very checkered history before becoming the indispensable partner of your tiredness and foodstuff with undeniable economic power!
